## üßæ About
**BraPolar v1.0**, is an Android m-Health for remote monitoring of patients with Bipolar Affective Disorder. The app present in real-time mood and behavior fluctuations to specialists from participants through their interaction with the mobile devices. This project was part of my master degree dissertation in Brazil. In this work, I could execute all software development cycles from scratch, application and documentation. Also, I could practice all research process of scientific research writing and presenting this work in a international conference at Kyoto, Japan.
